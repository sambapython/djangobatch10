In UBUNTU: sudo apt-get install docker.io

if you want to create ubuntu vm:

	docker run -it ubuntu:18.04 bash

this will runs one ubuntu container for yout to work. but you couldnot interact
with the services runing in the containers. this will be possible through the port maping. port mapping done by using -p option
docker run -it -p 82:80 ubuntu:18.04 bash

82 is an extrnal port, 80 is an internal port i.e: any service running in docker on 80 port can be accessed by 82 port.

if you want to go inside container and configure your porject, then

docker exec -it container id bash
